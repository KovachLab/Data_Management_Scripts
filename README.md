# Data_Management_Scripts
A general repository for our lab for managing little scripts useful for managing and backing up our data.

Repository includes:

1.) DuplicateDiscUsage.sh - A script to calculate md5 checksums recursively for all files in a directory and identify any file duplicates across directories for removal to free up space.

2.) FileBackupScript.sh - A script to backup data from the remote cluster to local hard drives. Also includes information on how to set up passwordless remote access to the cluster from your local computer.
